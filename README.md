# 📝 To-Do List (Console Version)

A simple **Python console application** that helps you manage your daily tasks by listing what you need to do, checking which ones are done, and viewing your progress.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Enter your daily tasks separated by commas  
- Track which tasks you’ve finished  
- View your completed and ongoing tasks  
- Friendly and simple text-based interface  

---

## 🖥️ How It Works
1. The program asks you to enter your tasks separated by commas.
2. For each task, it asks:  
   _“Did you finish this already?”_  
   - If you type **yes**, the task is marked as **Done ✅**  
   - Otherwise, it goes into **Ongoing 🕒**
3. At the end, the program shows your progress — all completed and ongoing tasks.

## 💡 Example Run

	•	Add a simple GUI using Tkinter
	•	Track tasks by priority or category
